# FEM.js
Model Civil Engineering Structures.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

You need a Web Browser and run a locar server.

#### Web Browser
Use the browser you want. I use _Google Chrome_.

#### Local server
You can run a local server with using _python_. If you have _python 2_, you can use
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
in the folder root.

If you have _python 3_, you can use
```
python3 -m http.server
```
